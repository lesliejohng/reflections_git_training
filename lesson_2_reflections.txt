git init
git status

What happens when you use the command git init?
git sets up the hidden files under a sub-directory .git
This allows git to recognise the directory as containing git information and sets up the logging and history required by git.

git add //adds to 'staging area'
git commit //commits files in the 'ataging area'

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area consists only of files seected from the working directory,so gives control over which to commit.
