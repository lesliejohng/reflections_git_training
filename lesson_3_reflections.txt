I added this note on github

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping work remotely is a good security process. (I am speaking from experience of hardware failure!) It allows sharing of information on an easy basis and access to the files on multiple machines.

git pull origin master

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The manual control allows you to manage changes and I can see how this would help especially in co-operative projects, I am not certain however how git manages multiple changes to the same branch as this could introduce a similar problem as seen in the merge cpmmand.
